# 4IT445 Agile web application development | Sportify

A web application Sportify, as a semestral work, manages teams, leagues, matches, and players with a huge load of statistics. Developed for the 4IT445 Agile web application development course.

## Frontend

  - The website is available at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). 
  
### Requirements 
 - Docker `2.1.0.1` or newer
 - Running **Database**
 - Running **Backend**
 - Node.js `10.16.2`or newer
 - Yarn `1.13.0` or newer
 
##### Dependencies
 
If the dev/build is erroneous, install the dependencies from `package.json` with `yarn install`.  After a few minutes, you should notice the generated `node_modules` folder and be able to execute commands defined in the `package.json` (`scripts`).

##### Development

Execute `yarn start` for happy coding. The web application should be available on [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

Optional: Remove line `BROWSER=none` at the `\frontend.env` file if you wish to open a browser with the webpage immediately.
